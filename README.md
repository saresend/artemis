This should never happen. We have the technology to make lines, ahem, online, and should be taking full advantage to protect the safety of our people.

## What is Artemis?

Artemis is a mobile app that helps people schedule when they should go to the store, based on when other people are going. People can sign up for a slot that has low attendance, helping both the store ensure that they don't end up overcrowded, as well as protecting customers from places that have a large amount of people.
