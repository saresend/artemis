## Motivation

Take a look at this picture from Costco:

This should never happen. We have the technology to make lines, ahem, online, and should be taking full advantage to protect the safety of our people. Now, more than ever, it is crucial that we give people the ability to have safe, pleasant experiences when venturing out of their homes for essentials.

## What is Artemis?

Artemis is a mobile app that helps people schedule when they should go to the store, based on when other people are going. People can sign up for a slot that has low attendance, helping both the store ensure that they don't end up overcrowded, as well as protecting customers from places that have a large amount of people. Not only that, but it gives people the ability to view all of the local businesses in the area, and schedule visits there as well.
